# computospirit

meditation for Electronic Rituals, Oracles and Fortune Telling, Spring 2019 with Allison Parrish

_a bash script that turns your computer into a medium. through automatic writing the computer attempts to get in touch with files from the dead._

1. clone this repo into your root directory (the directory with the little house in your finder)
2. `$ cd computospirit`
3. you may need to give the bash script the proper execute permission with the following command:
4. `$ chmod +x writing.sh`
4. `$ chmod +x random.sh`
4. `$ chmod +x computospirit.sh`
5. this script relies on `shuf`, a command that is baked into GNU core command line tools, if you're running MacOS and have homebrew you can install them easily with:
6. `$ brew install coreutils`
7. Finally you can ask your computer to get in touch with the file spirits:
8. `$ ./computospirit.sh`
